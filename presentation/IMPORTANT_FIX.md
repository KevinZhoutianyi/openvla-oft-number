# IMPORTANT FIX: Correct Evaluation of Regression Head

## Problem Discovered

The original evaluation script (`eval_place_shoe.py`) was **NOT using the trained regression head**!

### What Was Wrong:

1. **Training**: Correctly trained the regression head (MLP) with L1/L2/Huber/Smooth L1 losses
   - Regression head projects LLM hidden states â†’ continuous actions
   - Saved to checkpoint: `action_head--100_checkpoint.pt`

2. **Evaluation**: Only evaluated the base VLA token prediction
   - Did NOT load the action head
   - Only measured cross-entropy on discretized action tokens
   - Did NOT test the actual regression head predictions!

### Why This Happened:

The evaluation script was calling `model(...)` which gives you the VLA's token predictions, but never loaded or used the trained `action_head` that you spent 100 steps training!

## The Fix

### 1. New Evaluation Script: `eval_place_shoe_regression.py`

This script:
- âœ… Loads the trained LoRA adapters
- âœ… **Loads the trained action head** from checkpoint
- âœ… Runs forward pass through model to get hidden states
- âœ… Uses action head to predict continuous actions
- âœ… Computes **true L1 loss** on continuous predictions
- âœ… Analyzes per-dimension errors

### 2. New Comparison Script: `compare_losses_4gpu_regression.sh`

- Trains all 4 loss functions (L1, L2, Huber, Smooth L1)
- **Correctly evaluates each using the regression head**
- Generates proper comparison report

## What Changed in Results

### OLD Results (Incorrect):
- **Validation Loss**: Cross-entropy on VLA tokens
- **Action Accuracy**: Token prediction accuracy
- **L1 Loss**: L1 loss after decoding tokens to continuous
- **Problem**: Not actually testing your trained regression head!

### NEW Results (Correct):
- **L1 Loss**: Direct L1 loss from regression head predictions
- **Per-Dimension Errors**: Error for each of 14 joints
- **Tests**: The actual regression head you trained!

## Current Status

ðŸ”„ **Experiments Running**: `scripts/compare_losses_4gpu_regression.sh`

This is rerunning all 4 loss comparisons (L1, L2, Huber, Smooth L1) with:
- 100 training steps per loss
- 4 GPUs
- **Proper regression head evaluation**

Results will be in:
```
/work/hdd/bfdj/tzhou4/checkpoints/loss_comparison_regression_4gpu_<timestamp>/
```

## Impact on Presentation

The presentation will be updated to:
1. Explain that you're training a regression head
2. Show the **correct** results from regression head evaluation
3. Remove references to cross-entropy and token accuracy (those weren't relevant)
4. Focus on **true continuous action prediction performance**

## Key Insight

Training with different regression losses (L1/L2/Huber/Smooth L1) directly affects the continuous action prediction quality. Now we're measuring it correctly!

## Files Created/Modified:

1. **NEW**: `vla-scripts/eval_place_shoe_regression.py` - Correct evaluation
2. **NEW**: `scripts/compare_losses_4gpu_regression.sh` - Rerun experiments
3. **TODO**: Update `presentation/presentation_complete.tex` with new results
